# AI Final Project
Final project of AI course in the University Of Haifa by Shir Avneri and Ronnie Shafran.

In the project, we had to implement 5 search algorithms: UCS, IDS, A*, Bi directional A* and IDA* 
that are used to find a route to exit a given maze, if at all possible.

Input:
a text file that contains the desired algorithm, size of the matrix, start and goal node locations
and the maze itself - with each cell containing it's cost (-1 stands for a wall; all other costs 
are none-negative).

Output:
A series of statistics defined in the AlgorithmResult data structure that is returned by each algorithm's
run method. Note that some stats are only applicable for informed searches only.
